Responsible for collecting, cleaning, sorting, and analyzing large amounts of data. Basic mastery of programming in Excel, SQL databases, Python, and Tableau. Data analysts often work to build custom data systems and methods for collection and data analysis.

Advanced data analytics focus on machine learning and algorithm development for modeling trends and forecasting the future. This includes collecting that data and converting it to a usable format that can then be organized and analyzed - and often writing the code that performs the analysis itself. Programs like Python and R are most popular. Additionally, software development often use JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Python, and Java.
